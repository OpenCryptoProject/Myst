## Secure Multiparty Key Generation, Signature and Decryption JavaCard applet and host application
Cryptographic Hardware from Untrusted Components

This project implements novel distributed key generation, signature, and decryption with private key distributed among multiple separate entities. 

The research paper and other details are available at https://trojantoleranthardware.github.io/

This project is technology demonstrator and requires one or more smartcards with JavaCard platform with remaining players contributing to the protocols simulated in software.
